    <h2>About this document</h2>
      <p>This document describes the basic requirements for Indian Languages layout for display purpose. It discusses some of the major layout requirements in first letter pseudo-element, vertical arrangements of characters, letter spacing, text segmentation, line breaking rules in Indic languages.</p>
      <p>The current document focuses on Devanagari, but there are plans to widen the scope to encompass additional Indian scripts as time goes on.</p>
      <p>The minimal requirements presented in this document for  Indian languages text layout will also be used in E-publishing and CSS standards. This documents covers major issues of e-content in Indian languages in order to  create a standard format of text layout to address storage, rendering  problems, vertical writing, letter spacing, line breaking etc.</p>
    <p>It also describes a set of <abbr title="Augmented Backus–Naur Form">ABNF</abbr>-based rules for valid segmentation of Indic orthographic syllables in order to get the proper display in  browsers. Text segmentation[[!UAX29]] and line breaking  [[!UAX14]] algorithms are considered in detail. Standards for CSS and digital publications will benefit from this document.</p>

    <h2>Indian language complexities</h2>
    <p> India has large linguistic diversity with 22 constitutionally recognized languages and 12 scripts.This document is currently focused largely on the Devanagari script. The expectation is that over time its scope will widen to cover additional major scripts from the list below.</p>
    <p>The mapping between languages and scripts is complex. Multiple languages may have common scripts, while a language can be  written in multiple scripts. Each language and script is unique in nature and cannot be easily replicated, even if they share common characteristics. The orthographic changes may also occur in some languages and adoption of new orthography is a gradual process, thus posing additional challenges.</p>

    <p>The scripts of South Asia share so many common features that a side-by-side comparison
          of a few will often reveal structural similarities, even in modern letter forms. They are all
          abugidas in which most symbols stand for a consonant with an inherent vowel.The North Indian branch of scripts was, like Brahmi itself, mainly used to write Indo-European languages such as Pali and Sanskrit, and eventually the Hindi, Bengali, and Gujarati
          language, though it was also the source for scripts for non-Indo-European languages such
          as Tibetan, Mongolian, and Lepcha, as well as many South-East Asian scripts. The South Indian scripts are also derived from Brahmi and, therefore, share many similarities in structural characteristics. For more details visit [[!South-Asian-Scripts]].</p>

          <h4>Unicode Normalization</h4>
          <p>Unicode normalization [[!UAX15]] is a form of text normalization that transforms equivalent sequences of characters into the same representation. Unicode normalization is important in Unicode text processing applications, because it affects the semantics of comparing, searching, and sorting Unicode sequences</p>
          <p>When a unique representation is required , a normalized form of Unicode text can be used to eliminate unwanted distinctions. The key part of normalization is to provide a unique canonical order for visually non distinct sequences of combining characters.</p>

        <h5>Canonical &amp; Compatible Equivalence</h5>
        <p>Unicode contains numerous characters to maintain compatibility with existing standards, some of which are functionally equivalent to other characters or sequences of characters. Because of this, Unicode defines some code point sequences as equivalent. Unicode provides two notions of equivalence: canonical and compatible.</p>
        <p>Canonical equivalence is a form of equivalence that preserves visually and functionally equivalent characters.</p>

    <p>The linguistic definition of Indic orthographic syllable has been mapped to ABNF (Augmented Backus–Naur Form) for the purpose of text segmentation, line breaking , drop letter, letter spacing in horizontal text and vertical text representation. The definition has been elaborated , using examples from various Indic scripts in the table below.</p>
    <p>The definition is a combination of 3 rules :</p>
    <p>Rule 1 : V[m]</p>
    <p>Rule 2 : {CH}C[v][m]</p>
    <p>Rule 3 : CH  (This rule is applicable only at the end of the word)</p>
    V(upper case) is independent vowel<br />
    <br />
    m is modifier (Anusvara/Visarga/Chandrabindu)<br />
    <br />
    C is a consonant with inherent vowel which may or may not include a single nukta <br />
    <br />
    v (lower case) is any dependent vowel or vowel sign (mātrā)<br />

<section id="h_text_segmentation">
  <h2>Text segmentation</h2>
      <p>A string of Unicode-encoded text often needs to be broken up into text elements programmatically. Common examples of text elements include what users think of as characters, words, lines (more precisely, where line breaks are allowed), and sentences. The precise determination of text elements may vary according to orthographic conventions for a given script or language. The goal of matching user perceptions cannot always be met exactly because the text alone does not always contain enough information to unambiguously decide boundaries. For example, the period (U+002E FULL STOP) is used ambiguously, sometimes for end-of-sentence purposes, sometimes for abbreviations, and sometimes for numbers. In most cases, however, programmatic text boundaries can match user perceptions quite closely, although sometimes the best that can be done is not to surprise the user. Word boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The most familiar ones are selection (double-click mouse selection, or “move to next word” control-arrow keys), and “Whole Word Search” for search and replace. They are also used in database queries, to determine whether elements are within a certain number of words of one another .
    Grapheme cluster boundaries are   	important for collation, regular expressions, UI   	interactions (such as mouse selection, arrow key movement, backspacing),   	segmentation for vertical text, identification of boundaries for   	Initial-letter styling, and counting “character” positions within text.

<p>There are two syllables in this word: SA+VIRAMA+KA+UU and LA.  Note, however, that there are three Unicode grapheme clusters here: SA+VIRAMA, KA+UU and LA.</p>
<p>Styling is done on the basis of the whole orthographic syllable, not the first character, nor even the first grapheme. </p>

      <h2>Line breaking</h2>
      <p>When inline-level content is laid out into lines, it is broken across line boxes. Such a break is called a line break. In most  writing systems, in the absence of hyphenation a line break occurs only at word  boundaries. Many writing systems use spaces or punctuation to explicitly  separate words, and line break opportunities can be identified by these  characters. Line  breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section of  text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page, window  or other display area. </p>

    <h3>Hyphenation</h3>
    <p> There are different cases of hyphenation, some of the cases are given below :</p>
    <p><b>Case 1 :</b> Hyphens are commonly used in Copulative compounds words in Hindi language. Hindi has both prefixes and suffixes which are joined to words with a hyphen.</p>
        <p>नर-नारी, लाभ-हानि, माता-पिता, ऊंच-नीच</p>

    Rule 2: The definition of Indic orthographic syllable may be used to break the line and a hyphen should be at the breaking point so that word can be read intuitively

However the language specific morpho-phonemic rules and industry practices (from media, publishing and grammar books) could be used for hyphenation. U+ 00AD (soft hyphen) is used in some languages such as Tamil and Malayalam.
    <p><b>Rule 3: </b>The hyphenated words can be broken at the hyphen e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
          <li>नर-नारी should be treated as:</li>
          <li>नर- on the first line and नारी on the next line</li>
        </ul>
	      <p><img src="images/hyphen1.jpg" alt="hyphenation example at line breaking" width="793" height="377" /></p>
    <p><b>Rule 4:</b> Expression with mathematical symbol should be treated as single unit so that at the end of the line expression should not breaks at operator level</p>
    <p><b>Rule 5:</b> Breaking should not be allowed at numerical values such as currency values, year etc. e.g.</p>
    <p>“100.00” or “10,000”, nor in “12:59”</p>

    <h4>Selecting initial letters</h4>
    
    <p>Initial letters in Indic scripts must be selected on the basis of orthographic syllables, rather than individual letter forms (see an example at the end of <a href="#h_text_segmentation"></a>). A detailed definition of Indic syllables can be found in <a href="#h_indic_orthographic_syllable_boundaries"></a>. In Indian languages the size of the initial letter is determined by the number of the lines between the top line of the syllable and the lowest bit in the orthographic Indic syllable cluster where subjoined consonant and other diacritics  appear.</p></section>
    
      <section id="h_typical_drop_initial_usage_in_indic_scripts">
    <h4>Typical drop initial usage in Indic scripts</h4>
    <p>Most of the Indic drop initial letters in magazines and newspapers use 2 to 4 line drops. Some examples are shown below.</p>

   <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/dpub-latinreq/#raised-caps-and-sunken-caps">sunken and raised</a> initial letter are not preferred in Indian languages. In the above examples , reference points on the drop cap must align precisely with reference points in the text. .In Indic scripts the top reference point is the hanging base line for those scripts that have one, and the mean/median line for those that don't, and the bottom alignment point is the text after-edge</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#initial-letter-wrapping">Initial letter wrap property</a> is not applicable for Indian languages. No <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-inline-3/#initial-letter-wrapping">contour-filling</a> is required in Indian languages.</p>
    <p>Alignment of the top line of the non-highlighted characters  at the top of the thicker top line of the initial letter is common in India. In some examples the top lines of the initial letter and the following letters don't touch. This is due to variable technology/formats used by the publishers. It is preferred that both the top lines of Initial letter and neighbouring text should touch.</p>
    <p>Here are some additional  examples of initial highlighted letter and drop letter based on the Indic syllable definition.</p>

  <h4>Alignment of Initial letter of Indic scripts with hanging baseline</h4>
  <p>Indian languages which use hanging baseline such as Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi etc.
The part from the hanging baseline and the ascent of the Initial letter may follow the following mechanism, where n = h/2:</p>

          <figcaption>Rule of  Indic script  with hanging baseline</figcaption>
        </figure>
 <p>In Indic scripts that have a hanging baseline, the top alignment point is the hanging baseline, and the bottom alignment point is the text-after-edge, and the hanging baselines of both the initial letter and first line of text should be  aligned.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="h_scripts_without_hanging_baseline">
<h4>Scripts that don't have hanging baseline such as Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam , Odia etc</h4>

   <p>Publishers in India commonly used the following rules for such scripts:</p>
   <ul>
   <li>The height of the initial letter is based on the Indic orthographic  syllable described in <a href="#h_indic_orthographic_syllable_boundaries"></a>.</li>
   <li>Ascent of the first non-highlighted line is equal to the median/mean line of the initial letter as shown below :</li>
   </ul>
   <img src="images/dropcap-south-new.png" alt="rule for South Indian languages" />
   <p>Based on above observations the general rule for South Indian languages  Indian languages scripts  will be :</p>
   <ul>
   <li> ¼ height of the total Drop Cap Height projected or ascended above the ascent of the first-line</li>
   <li>¾ of the total Drop Cap Height occupied or descended from ascent of first line or X1 to descent of the last line or line XN.</li>

    <h3>Letter Spacing</h3>
    <p>In styling issues like horizontal spacing, the spacing between characters like C E R T I F I C A T E, the space is given between the every character in case of English. But in case of Indian language, the space needs to be introduced after each syllable for correct representation.</p>
    <p>Letter spacing in Indian Languages is used . In some of the languages like Bengali it is more prevalent .  In Hindi , which is the largest speaking language in India the  character spacing is sometimes used. Also it is used for decorative style of writing such as Newspaper Column , banner etc. Here is the example of the name plate of the Museum. The top bar is broken in letter spacing and the space letter is added between orthographic syllable.</p>
    <p>Here is the some examples of letter spacing that based on definition :</p>
    <ol>
    <li>अं त र्रा ष्ट्री य क र ण</li>
    <li>स्वा ग त म्</li>
    <li>सु स ज्जि त</li>
    <li>स म्प्र ति</li>

      <section id="h_collation">
    <h3>Collation</h3>
    <p>Collation is one of the most important features for Indic languages . It determines the order in which a given culture indexes its characters. This is best seen in a dictionary sorting order where for easy search words are sorted and arranged in a specific order. Within a given script, each allo-script may have a different sort-order. Thus in Hindi the conjunct glyph क्ष is sorted along with क , since the first letter of that conjunct is क and on a similar principle ज्ञ is sorted along with ज . The same is not the case with Marathi and Nepali which admit a different sort order.</p>
    <p>Different scripts admit different sort orders and for all high
          end NLP applications. Sorting is
          a crucial feature to ensure that the applications index data as per the cultural perception of
          that community. In quite a few States, sort order is clearly defined by the statutory bodies
          of that state and hence it is crucial that such sort order be ascertained and introduced in
          the document
          .</p>
    <p>The order(left to right) as given below is pertinent to sorting by a computer program and is compliant
          with CLDR as laid down by Unicode.</p>
