    <h2>About this document</h2>
      <p>This document describes the basic requirements for Indian Languages layout for display purpose. It discusses some of the major layout requirements in first letter pseudo-element, vertical arrangements of characters, letter spacing, text segmentation, line breaking and collation rules in Indic languages.</p>
      <p>The current document focuses on Devanagari, but there are plans to widen the scope to encompass additional Indian scripts as time goes on.</p>
      <p>The minimal requirements presented in this document for  Indian languages text layout will also be used in E-publishing and CSS Standard. This documents covers major issues of e-content in Indian languages in order to  create standardize format of text layout to address storage, rendering  problems, vertical writing, letter spacing, collation, line breaking etc.</p>
      <p>It also describes the definition of ABNF(Augmented Backus–Naur Form)
    based valid segmentation-Indic orthographic syllable in order to get the proper display in the browsers. The text segmentation[[!UAX29]] and line breaking  [[!UAX14]] algorithms are considered in detail. The CSS & digital publications standards will benefit from this document.</p>

    <h2>Indian language complexities</h2>
    <p> India has large linguistic diversity with 22 constitutionally recognized languages and 12 scripts.This document is currently focused on the Devanagari script. The expectation is that over time its scope will widen to cover additional major scripts from the list below.</p>
    <p>The mapping between languages and scripts is complex. Multiple languages may have common scripts, while a language can be  written in multiple scripts. Each language and script is unique in nature and cannot be easily replicated, even if they share common characteristics. The orthographic changes may also occur in some languages and adoption of new orthography is a gradual process, thus posing additional challenges.</p>

    <p>The scripts of South Asia share so many common features that a side-by-side comparison
          of a few will often reveal structural similarities even in the modern letter forms. They are all
          abugidas in which most symbols stand for a consonant plus an inherent vowel (usually the sound /a/).The North Indian branch of scripts was, like Brahmi itself, mainly used to write Indo-European languages such as Pali and Sanskrit, and eventually the Hindi, Bengali, and Gujarati
          languages, though it was also the source for scripts for non-Indo-European languages such
          as Tibetan, Mongolian, and Lepcha. The South Indian scripts are also derived from Brahmi and, therefore, share many similarities in structural characteristics. For more details visit [[!South-Asian-Scripts]].</p>
    <p>The following figure shows the evolution of Indian scripts over a period of times from Brahmi script.</p>

          <h4>Unicode Normalization</h4>
          <p>Unicode normalization[[!UAX15]] is a form of text normalization that transforms equivalent sequences of characters into the same representation. Unicode normalization is important in Unicode text processing applications, because it affects the semantics of comparing, searching, and sorting Unicode sequences</p>
          <p>When a unique representation is required , a normalized form of Unicode text can be used to eliminate unwanted distinctions. The key part of normalization is to provide a unique canonical order for visually non distinct sequences of combining characters.</p>
          
      <section id="h_canonical_and_compatible_equivalence">
        <h5>Canonical &amp; Compatible Equivalence</h5>
        <p>Unicode contains numerous characters to maintain compatibility with existing standards, some of which are functionally equivalent to other characters or sequences of characters. Because of this, Unicode defines some code point sequences as equivalent. Unicode provides two notions of equivalence: canonical and compatible.</p>
        <p>Canonical equivalence is a form of equivalence that preserves visually and functionally equivalent characters.</p>
        <p>The following figure shows the canonical equivalence:</p>

<section id="h_text_segmentation">
  <h2>Text segmentation</h2>
      <p>A string of Unicode-encoded text often needs to be broken up into text elements programmatically. Common examples of text elements include what users think of as characters, words, lines (more precisely, where line breaks are allowed), and sentences. The precise determination of text elements may vary according to orthographic conventions for a given script or language. The goal of matching user perceptions cannot always be met exactly because the text alone does not always contain enough information to unambiguously decide boundaries. For example, the period (U+002E FULL STOP) is used ambiguously, sometimes for end-of-sentence purposes, sometimes for abbreviations, and sometimes for numbers. In most cases, however, programmatic text boundaries can match user perceptions quite closely, although sometimes the best that can be done is not to surprise the user. Word boundaries are used in a number of different contexts. The most familiar ones are selection (double-click mouse selection, or “move to next word” control-arrow keys), and “Whole Word Search” for search and replace. They are also used in database queries, to determine whether elements are within a certain number of words of one another .
    Some special sentence boundaries like the double poorna virama, possibly with numbers (as in Sanskrit text, shlokas etc.) Grapheme cluster boundaries are   	important for collation, regular expressions, UI   	interactions (such as mouse selection, arrow key movement, backspacing),   	segmentation for vertical text, identification of boundaries for   	Initial-letter styling, and counting “character” positions within text. [[!UAX29]]</p>
      <p>Solution for word boundaries:<br />
    User-percieved characters boundaries  should be based on tailored Grapheme Cluster Boundaries to conform Indic orthographic syllable definition <br />
  </p>
      <p>In case of Devanagari phrase separator called Danda or purnaviram (।) and double danda (।।: used to mark end of the verse),In some of the browsers ending word is selected with purnaviram on double-click while in some browsers Danda is selected as a separate. It is recommended that  line should not  begin with purnaviram/Danda and double danda. So the properties of Danda should be same as the properties of FullStop or other punctuation marks so that new line should not begin with Danda and double danda.</p>
      <p>For others characters, the text segmentation should be done as Indic orthographic syllable.</p>
      <p>Indic script behavior in initial letter styling is based on syllables, rather than individual letter forms.</p> 
      <img src="images/drop-letter1.jpg" alt="example of drop letter"/>

<p>The above Figure  shows an example of a drop intial in Hindi. In the first word of the paragraph, स्कूल ('skūl'), the sequence of characters is stored in memory is as follows:</p>
<img src="images/initial-letter-ex.jpg" alt="initial letter example" />
<p>There are two syllables in this word: SA+VIRAMA+KA+UU and LA.  Note, however, that there are three Unicode grapheme clusters here: SA+VIRAMA, KA+UU and LA.</p>
<p>Styling is done on the basis of the whole orthographic syllable, not the first character, nor even the first grapheme. </p>
<p>A syllable includes a base consonant and any combination of the following characters in the text stream:</p>
<ul>
<li>sequences of consonants preceded by virama (i.e. conjuncts).</li>
<li>vowel signs</li>
<li>visarga, anusvara or candrabindu.</li>

<section id="h_line_breaking">
      <h2>Line breaking</h2>
      <p>When inline-level content is laid out into lines, it is broken across line boxes. Such a break is called a line break. In most  writing systems, in the absence of hyphenation a line break occurs only at word  boundaries. Many writing systems use spaces or punctuation to explicitly  separate words, and line break opportunities can be identified by these  characters. Line  breaking, also known as word wrapping, is the process of breaking a section of  text into lines such that it will fit in the available width of a page, window  or other display area. </p>

    <h3>Guiding principles of Line breaking for Indian languages</h3>
    <p>In Indic writing system , it is preferred that line breaks at word boundaries ,if required following principles may be adhered :</p>
    <p><b>Rule 1:</b> New line cannot begin with following symbols/Punctuation marks. Also these should be retain with the associated text</p>
    <ul>
          <li>Closing brackets</li>
          <li>Devanagari Danda /Purnaviram</li>

          <li>Semicolon</li>
          <li>Repetition of punctuation marks such as semicolon with closing brackets, Semicolon with single/ Double quotes , Closing brackets with commas/Semicolon etc</li>
          <li>Mathematical operators</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b>Rule 2: </b>The definition of Indic orthographic syllable may be used to break the line and a hyphen should be at the breaking point so that word can be read intuitively</p>
    <p><b>Rule 3: </b>The hyphenated words can be broken at the hyphen e.g.:</p>
    <ul>
          <li>नर-नारी should be treated as:</li>
          <li>नर- on the first line and नारी on the next line</li>
        </ul>
    <p><b>Rule 4:</b> Expression with mathematical symbol should be treated as single unit so that at the end of the line expression should not breaks at operator level</p>
    <p><b>Rule 5:</b> Breaking should not be allowed at numerical values such as currency values, year etc. e.g.</p>
    <p>“100.00” or “10,000”, nor in “12:59”</p>

    <h4>Selecting initial letters</h4>
    
    <p>Initial letters in Indic scripts must be selected on the basis of orthographic syllables, rather than individual letter forms (see an example at the end of section 3, Text segmentation). The orthographic syllable may be a single Consonant/Vowel or the combinations of Unicode code points. A detailed definition of Indic syllables can be found in section 2, Indic Syllable boundaries.In Indian languages the size of the Initial Letter is determined by the number of the lines between top line of the syllable and lowest bit in the orthographic Indic syllable cluster where subjoined consonant and other diacritics  appears.</p></section>

    <h4>Typical drop initial usage in Indic scripts</h4>
    <p>Most of the Indic drop initial letters in magazines and newspapers use 2 to 4 line drops. Some examples are shown below.</p>

        </figure>
   <p>The Sunken and raised Initial letter are not preffered in Indian languages.In examples of this kind, reference points on the drop cap must align precisely with reference points in the text. In Indic scripts the top reference point is the hanging base line for those scripts that have one, and the bottom alignment point is the text after-edge.</p>
    <p>Initial letter wrap property is not applicable for Indian languages.No contour-filling is required in Indian languages.</p>
    <p>Alignment of the top line of the non-highlighted characters is at the top of the thicker top line of the initial letter is commonly used in India.In some examples top lines of the initial letter and the following letters don't touch. This is due to variable technology/formats used by the publishers. It is preferred that both the top lines of Initial letter and neighbouring text should touch.Here are some additional  examples of initial highlighted letter and drop letter based on the Indic syllable definition.</p>

  <section id="h_indic_scripts_with_hanging_baseline">
  <h4>Alignment of Initial letter of Indic scripts with hanging baseline</h4>
  <p>Indian languages which use hanging baseline such as Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi etc.
The part from the hanging baseline and the ascent of the Initial letter may follow the following mechanism  :</p>

          <figcaption>Rule of  Indic script  with hanging baseline</figcaption>
        </figure>
         <p>Where n=h/2</p>
      <p>In Indic scripts that have hanging baseline, the top alignment point is the hanging baseline, and the bottom alignment point is the text-after-edge and both the Initial letter and first line of text should be same aligned.</p>
      </section>
      
      <section id="h_scripts_without_hanging_baseline">
<h4>Scripts that don't have hanging baseline such as Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam , Odia etc</h4>

   <p>The publishers in India commonly used following rules for such scripts :</p>
   <ul>
   <li>The height of the Initial letter is based on the Indic orthographic  syllable described in section 2.</li>
   <li>Ascent of the first non highlighted line is equal t   o the median/mean line of the Initial letter as shown below :</li>
   </ul>
   <img src="images/dropcap-south.png" alt="rule for South Indian languages" />
   <p>Based on above observations the general rule for South Indian languages  Indian languages scripts  will be :</p>
   <ul>
   <li> ¼ height of the total Drop Cap Height projected or ascended above the ascent of the first-line</li>
   <li>¾ of the total Drop Cap Height occupied or descended from ascent of first line or X1 to descent of the last line or line XN.</li>

                <h4>Initial Letter box formatting in Indian languages</h4>
        <p>The Indian publishers commonly used different height of the boxes and sizes of the characters. But it is proposed that the syllable with in the box is centre-aligned with reference to box parameters as shown in the figure below :</p>

    <h3>Letter Spacing</h3>
    <p>In styling issues like horizontal spacing, the spacing between characters like C E R T I F I C A T E, the space is given between the every character in case of English. But in case of Indian language, the space needs to be introduced after each syllable for correct representation.</p>
    <p>For letter spacing in Indian languages it is recommended that spacing should follow Indic orthographic syllable definition. </p>
    <p>Here is the some examples of letter spacing that based on definition :</p>
    <ol>
    <li>अं त र्रा ष्ट्री य क र ण</li>
    <li>स्वा ग त म्</li>
    <li>सु स ज्जि त</li>

    <h3>Vertical arrangements of characters</h3>
    <p>In vertical arrangement of characters writing each character on a new line may not be suitable in Indian languages. The vertical arrangements of characters are sometimes used in Indian texts. In order to form correct arrangements, it is preferred to follow tailored grapheme cluster approach.
          Variations of vertical arrangement of the characters in Hindi is represent below :</p>

    <h3>Collation</h3>
    <p>Collation is one of the most important features for Indic languages . It determines the order in which a given culture indexes its characters. This is best seen in a dictionary sorting order where for easy search words are sorted and arranged in a specific order. Within a given script, each allo-script may have a different sort-order. Thus in Hindi the conjunct glyph क्ष is sorted along with क , since the first letter of that conjunct is क and on a similar principle ज्ञ is sorted along with ज . The same is not the case with Marathi and Nepali which admit a different sort order.</p>
    <p>Different scripts admit different sort orders and for all high
          end NLP applications. Sorting is
          a crucial feature to ensure that the applications index data as per the cultural perception of
          that community. In quite a few States, sort order is clearly defined by the statutory bodies
          of that state and hence it is crucial that such sort order be ascertained and introduced in
          the document
          .</p>
    <p>The order(left to right) as given below is pertinent to sorting by a computer program and is compliant
          with CLDR as laid down by Unicode.</p>
